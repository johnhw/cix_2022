  abstract = {In most brain computer interface (BCI) systems, some target users have significant difficulty in using BCI systems. Such target users are called `BCI-illiterate'. This phenomenon has been poorly investigated, and a clear understanding of the BCI-illiteracy mechanism or a solution to this problem has not been reported to date. In this study, we sought to demonstrate the neurophysiological differences between two groups (literate, illiterate) with a total of 52 subjects. We investigated recordings under non-task related state (NTS) which is collected during subject is relaxed with eyes open. We found that high theta and low alpha waves were noticeable in the BCI-illiterate relative to the BCI-literate people. Furthermore, these high theta and low alpha wave patterns were preserved across different mental states, such as NTS, resting before motor imagery (MI), and MI states, even though the spatial distribution of both BCI-illiterate and BCI-literate groups did not differ. From these findings, an effective strategy for pre-screening subjects for BCI illiteracy has been determined, and a performance factor that reflects potential user performance has been proposed using a simple combination of band powers. Our proposed performance factor gave an r = 0.59 (r2 = 0.34) in a correlation analysis with BCI performance and yielded as much as r = 0.70 (r2 = 0.50) when seven outliers were rejected during the evaluation of whole data (N = 61), including BCI competition datasets (N = 9). These findings may be directly applicable to online BCI systems.},

  abstract = {In line with the mission of the Assistive Technology Act of 1998 (ATA), this study proposes an integrated assistive real-time system which "affirms that technology is a valuable tool that can be used to improve the lives of people with disabilities." An assistive technology device is defined by the ATA as "any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities." The purpose of this study is to design and develop an alternate input device that can be used even by individuals with severe motor disabilities. This real-time system design utilizes electromyographic (EMG) biosignals from cranial muscles and electroencephalographic (EEG) biosignals from the cerebrum's occipital lobe, which are transformed into controls for two-dimensional (2-D) cursor movement, the left-click (Enter) command, and an ON/OFF switch for the cursor-control functions. This HCI system classifies biosignals into "mouse" functions by applying amplitude thresholds and performing power spectral density (PSD) estimations on discrete windows of data. Spectral power summations are aggregated over several frequency bands between 8 and 500 Hz and then compared to produce the correct classification. The result is an affordable DSP-based system that, when combined with an on-screen keyboard, enables the user to fully operate a computer without using any extremities.},

It shows that user experience and target size on the interface are the predominant factors affecting eye-based pointing and suggests that these could be overcome to enable eye-based pointing to be a viable and available direct manipulation interaction technique for the motor-disabled community.},

  abstract = {The problem of human-computer interaction (HCI) is an issue of, not only matching system functionality to the needs of the user in a specific work context, but also a question of presenting an image of the system that can be easily understood. Attempts to support design in such a way so as to overcome these problems are characterized as having moved through the `guidelines' approach of the 1970s, to an `analytic methods' perspective in the 1980s. However, existing approaches account for only limited aspects of interaction, and areas such as the misunderstandings (errors) that users experience have received less attention. In addition, attempts to construct methods that might allow designers to analyse and understand user errors have met with only limited success. It has been suggested that the theories and constructs embodied within some of the analytic methods might be of use (although such claims have not been made by the originators of these methods). We consider the failure of a usable tool (ECM), and the limited HCI theories embodied in TAG and GOMS, to adequately account for three example errors. This failure, it is argued, suggests that the next stage is for those within the HCI field to develop broad theories of understanding and action, that can form the basis for design tools, and be communicated to designers.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic programming aims to help users make decisions under uncertainty. The user writes code representing a probabilistic model, and receives outcomes as distributions or summary statistics. We consider probabilistic programming for end-users, in particular spreadsheet users, estimated to number in tens to hundreds of millions. We examine the sources of uncertainty actually encountered by spreadsheet users, and their coping mechanisms, via an interview study. We examine spreadsheet-based interfaces and technology to help reason under uncertainty, via probabilistic and other means. We show how uncertain values can propagate uncertainty through spreadsheets, and how sheet-defined functions can be applied to handle uncertainty. Hence, we draw conclusions about the promise and limitations of probabilistic programming for end-users.},

GestureBar leverages the familiar, clean look of a common toolbar, but in place of executing commands, richly discloses how to execute commands with gestures, through animated images, detail tips and an out-of-document practice area. GestureBar's simple design is also general enough for use with any recognition technique and for integration with standard, non-gestural UI components. We evaluate GestureBar in a formal experiment showing that users can perform complex, ecologically valid tasks in a purely gestural system without training, introduction, or prior gesture experience when using GestureBar, discovering and learning a high percentage of the gestures needed to perform the tasks optimally, and significantly outperforming a state of the art crib sheet. The relative contribution of the major design elements of GestureBar is also explored. A second experiment shows that GestureBar is preferred to a basic crib sheet and two enhanced crib sheet variations.},

In many cases, the models are complex and the parameters unintuitive for non-experts. In this paper, we present an optimization method for setting parameters of a procedural fluid animation system by showing the user examples of different parametrized animations and asking for feedback. Our method employs the Bayesian technique of bringing in "prior" belief based on previous runs of the system and/or expert knowledge, to assist users in finding good parameter settings in as few steps as possible. To do this, we introduce novel extensions to Bayesian optimization, which permit effective learning for parameter-based procedural animation applications. We show that even when users are trying to find a variety of different target animations, the system can learn and improve. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to related active learning methods. We also present a working application for assisting animators in the challenging task of designing curl-based velocity fields, even with minimal domain knowledge other than identifying when a simulation "looks right".},

It helps developers to handle uncertain input and implement feedback and GUI adaptations. ProbUI replaces today's static target models (bounding boxes) with probabilistic gestures ("bounding behaviours"). It is the first touch GUI framework to unite concepts from three areas of related work: 1) Developers declaratively define touch behaviours for GUI targets. As a key insight, the declarations imply simple probabilistic models (HMMs with 2D Gaussian emissions). 2) ProbUI derives these models automatically to evaluate users' touch sequences. 3) It then infers intended behaviour and target. Developers bind callbacks to gesture progress, completion, and other conditions. We show ProbUI's value by implementing existing and novel widgets, and report developer feedback from a survey and a lab study.},

We describe these functions and report on an experiment that compared the default one of the three systems. Our results show that these default functions improve performance up to 24\% compared to a unitless constant CD gain. We also found significant differences between them, with the one from OS X improving performance for small target widths but reducing its performance up to 9\% for larger ones compared to Windows and Xorg. These results notably suggest replacing the constant CD gain function commonly used by HCI researchers by the default function of the considered systems.},

Second, rollover-typing, wherein the next key is pressed before the previous one is released, is sur- prisingly prevalent. Notwithstanding considerable variation in typing patterns, unsupervised clustering using normalised inter-key intervals reveals that most users can be divided into eight groups of typists that differ in performance, accuracy, hand and finger usage, and rollover.

Designers typically rely on experience or subjective judgment in the absence of analytical or objective means for selecting interface parameters. We demonstrate Bayesian optimization as an efficient tool for objective interface feature refinement. Specifically, we show that crowdsourcing paired with Bayesian optimization can rapidly and effectively assist interface design across diverse deployment environments. Experiment 1 evaluates the approach on a familiar 2D interface design problem: a map search and review use case. Adding a degree of complexity, Experiment 2 extends Experiment 1 by switching the deployment environment to mobile-based virtual reality. The approach is then demonstrated as a case study for a fundamentally new and unfamiliar interaction design problem: web-based augmented reality. Finally, we show how the model generated as an outcome of the refinement process can be used for user simulation and queried to deliver various design insights.},

Both the required amplitude (A) of a movement, and the width (W) of the target that S was required to hit, had a large and systematic effect on MT, whereas they had a relatively small effect on RT. Defining an index of movement difficulty as ID = log22A/W, the correlation between ID and MT was found to be above .99 over the ID range from 2.6 to 7.6 bits per response. Thus the times for discrete movements follow the same type of law as was found earlier to hold for serial responses. The relative independence of RT and MT is interpreted as pointing to the serial and independent nature of perceptual and motor processes. (17 ref.)

  abstract = {Adaptive agents must occupy a limited repertoire of states and therefore minimize the long-term average of surprise associated with sensory exchanges with the world. Minimizing surprise enables them to resist a natural tendency to disorder.Surprise rests on predictions about sensations, which depend on an internal generative model of the world. Although surprise cannot be measured directly, a free-energy bound on surprise can be, suggesting that agents minimize free energy by changing their predictions (perception) or by changing the predicted sensory inputs (action).Perception optimizes predictions by minimizing free energy with respect to synaptic activity (perceptual inference), efficacy (learning and memory) and gain (attention and salience). This furnishes Bayes-optimal (probabilistic) representations of what caused sensations (providing a link to the Bayesian brain hypothesis).Bayes-optimal perception is mathematically equivalent to predictive coding and maximizing the mutual information between sensations and the representations of their causes. This is a probabilistic generalization of the principle of efficient coding (the infomax principle) or the minimum-redundancy principle.Learning under the free-energy principle can be formulated in terms of optimizing the connection strengths in hierarchical models of the sensorium. This rests on associative plasticity to encode causal regularities and appeals to the same synaptic mechanisms as those underlying cell assembly formation.Action under the free-energy principle reduces to suppressing sensory prediction errors that depend on predicted (expected or desired) movement trajectories. This provides a simple account of motor control, in which action is enslaved by perceptual (proprioceptive) predictions.Perceptual predictions rest on prior expectations about the trajectory or movement through the agent's state space. These priors can be acquired (as empirical priors during hierarchical inference) or they can be innate (epigenetic) and therefore subject to selective pressure.Predicted motion or state transitions realized by action correspond to policies in optimal control theory and reinforcement learning. In this context, value is inversely proportional to surprise (and implicitly free energy), and rewards correspond to innate priors that constrain policies.},

I will meet this challenge by dealing with the future and then turning to its history. The future of the Bayesian brain (in neuroimaging) is clear: it is the application of dynamic causal modeling to understand how the brain conforms to the free energy principle. In this context, the Bayesian brain is a corollary of the free energy principle, which says that any self organizing system (like a brain or neuroimaging community) must maximize the evidence for its own existence, which means it must minimize its free energy using a model of its world. Dynamic causal modeling involves finding models of the brain that have the greatest evidence or the lowest free energy. In short, the future of imaging neuroscience is to refine models of the brain to minimize free energy, where the brain refines models of the world to minimize free energy. This endeavor itself minimizes free energy because our community is itself a self organizing system. I cannot imagine an alternative future that has the same beautiful self consistency as mine. Having dispensed with the future, we can now focus on the past, which is much more interesting:},

It describes some ways in which pairs of novice users deal with what they see as "trouble" in the operation of a multiwindow database system called Sales and Marketing Information (SAM). A typical sequence has the character of a user request followed by a pause or computer granting, leading to user repair in initial or third position. Three components of repair are identified: The user attempts to get the computer to undo a previous granting, redo a previous request, or grant a new request. Some common ways in which these components are combined, ordered, and performed are illustrated with reference to transcripts of actual sequences of recorded interaction. The relevance of these findings for design is discussed, together with the future potential of the approach that generated them.},

We first study the spread of hits in a rapid approximate pointing task at varied distances and movement angles. Consistent with the literature, our results show that the spread of hits along the movement direction deviate more than the spread of hits in the direction perpendicular to movement, and both spreads increase with distance. Based on the distribution of this spread of hits, we propose and validate a new probabilistic model that describes two-dimensional pointing. Unlike previous models, our model accounts for more variables of two-dimensional pointing and can be generalized to any target shape, size, orientation, location, and dimension. In contrast to previous work, which suggests that target height has minimal impact on performance when it is larger than the width, our results show that, even when height is greater than width, it can significantly impact movement time.},

In all cases reported in this paper, the voluntary muscles, including the oculomotor muscles, deteriorated rapidly, resulting in respiratory failure within 1.5 years. Successive observation of the 4 cases confirmed that ontogenetically old motor functions, including oculomotor functions, were preserved in the advanced stage, and that the main lesions in the oculomotor system were supranuclear. The 2 autopsied cases showed widespread pathological lesions other than those of the pyramidal tract and motoneurons commonly seen in ALS. We review these findings, and discuss them from an ontogenetical aspect in terms of the development of motor functions and anatomical myelination, and compare them with clinico-pathological findings of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and anatomical structures of the supranuclear oculomotor system in monkeys.},

Intentions are subdivided into goal intentions and their contingent instrumental intentions. The latter are generated to overcome anticipated difficulties in three problem areas: initiation, implementation, and termination of an intended action. The action-guiding intention can be identified at various goal levels that relate to the alternative modes of implementation-imminent or wide-spanned goal representations. An ongoing action is controlled by a wide-spanned mode whenever implementation consists of automatized acts that require little or no conscious control. A wide-spanned goal representation facilitates the simultaneous execution of related or unrelated activity. The 2 control modes of narrow and wide goal span set the stage for the occurrence of action slips. A collection of various action slips can be categorized according to the 3 problem areas in the enactment of goal intentions: initiation, implementation, and termination slips. This categorization helps to elucidate the various types of action slips, and it highlights the effectiveness of instrumental intentions.

  abstract = {Touchscreens became the dominant input device for smartphones. Users' touch behaviour has been widely studied in lab studies with a relative low number of participants. In contrast, we published a game in the Android Market that records the touch behaviour when executing a controlled task to collect large amounts of touch events. Players' task is to simply touch circles appearing on the screen. Data from 91,731 installations has been collected and players produced 120,626,225 touch events. We determined the error rates for different target sizes and screen locations. The amount of data enabled us to show that touch positions are systematically skewed. A compensation function that shifts the users' touches to reduce the amount of errors is derived from the data and evaluated by publishing an update of the game. The independent-measures experiment with data from 12,201 installations and 15,326,444 touch events shows that the function reduces the error rate by 7.79\%. We argue that such a compensation function could improve the touch performance of virtually every smartphone user.},

Historically, nomograms enjoyed wide use as analog computation devices, but understandably fell out of favor with the advent of more powerful calculators, computers, and related software. Yet, certain examples of nomograms encode complex relationships that are not easily visualized using more common forms such as function graphs, especially when the underlying relationship involves 4 or more parameters. Moreover, findings from cognitive science, in particular on physical imagery, suggest that the nature of interactions with such nomograms might lead users to construct qualitatively different understandings than if they had used other forms of graphs or visualizations.

  abstract = {Understanding and accounting for uncertainty is critical to effectively reasoning about visualized data. However, evaluating the impact of an uncertainty visualization is complex due to the difficulties that people have interpreting uncertainty and the challenge of defining correct behavior with uncertainty information. Currently, evaluators of uncertainty visualization must rely on general purpose visualization evaluation frameworks which can be ill-equipped to provide guidance with the unique difficulties of assessing judgments under uncertainty. To help evaluators navigate these complexities, we present a taxonomy for characterizing decisions made in designing an evaluation of an uncertainty visualization. Our taxonomy differentiates six levels of decisions that comprise an uncertainty visualization evaluation: the behavioral targets of the study, expected effects from an uncertainty visualization, evaluation goals, measures, elicitation techniques, and analysis approaches. Applying our taxonomy to 86 user studies of uncertainty visualizations, we find that existing evaluation practice, particularly in visualization research, focuses on Performance and Satisfaction-based measures that assume more predictable and statistically-driven judgment behavior than is suggested by research on human judgment and decision making. We reflect on common themes in evaluation practice concerning the interpretation and semantics of uncertainty, the use of confidence reporting, and a bias toward evaluating performance as accuracy rather than decision quality. We conclude with a concrete set of recommendations for evaluators designed to reduce the mismatch between the conceptualization of uncertainty in visualization versus other fields.},

Behavior analysis has begun to adopt these tools as a novel means of measuring the interrelations between behavior, stimuli, and contingent outcomes. This approach holds great promise for making more precise determinations about the causes of behavior and the forms in which conditioning may be encoded by organisms. In addition to providing an introduction to the basics of information theory, we review some of the ways that information theory has informed the studies of Pavlovian conditioning, operant conditioning, and behavioral neuroscience. In addition to enriching each of these empirical domains, information theory has the potential to act as a common statistical framework by which results from different domains may be integrated, compared, and ultimately unified.},

Some attempt to minimize the impact of the prior on the posterior, allowing the data to ``speak for themselves,'' or to provide Bayesian inferences that have good frequentist properties. In contrast, this note focuses on priors where scientific knowledge is used, possibly partially informative. There are many articles on the use of such subjective information. We focus on using standard software for eliciting priors from subject-matter specialists, in the form of models such as the binomial, Poisson, and normal. Our approach uses a common spreadsheet package with the facility to display dynamic pictures of prior distributions as the user toggles scroll bars or ``sliders'' that manipulate parameters of particular distributions. This allows interactive exploration of the shape of a probability distribution. We have found this a useful tool when eliciting priors for Bayesian data analysis. We present examples to illustrate the scope and flexibility of the method. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Our method is based on a natural partitioning of continuous sensor signals and uses a two-stage approach for the spotting task. In a first stage, signal sections likely to contain specific motion events are preselected using a simple similarity search. Those preselected sections are then further classified in a second stage, exploiting the recognition capabilities of hidden Markov models. Based on two case studies, we discuss implementation details of our approach and show that it is a feasible strategy for the spotting of various types of motion events.},

  abstract = {Using brain-computer interfaces (BCI) humans can select letters or other targets on a computer screen without any muscular involvement. An intensively investigated kind of BCI is based on the recording of visual event-related brain potentials (ERP). However, some severely paralyzed patients who need a BCI for communication have impaired vision or lack control of gaze movement, thus making a BCI depending on visual input no longer feasible. In an effort to render the ERP-BCI usable for this group of patients, the ERP-BCI was adapted to auditory stimulation. Letters of the alphabet were assigned to cells in a 5 x 5 matrix. Rows of the matrix were coded with numbers 1 to 5, and columns with numbers 6 to 10, and the numbers were presented auditorily. To select a letter, users had to first select the row and then the column containing the desired letter. Four severely paralyzed patients in the end-stage of a neurodegenerative disease were examined. All patients performed above chance level. Spelling accuracy was significantly lower with the auditory system as compared with a similar visual system. Patients reported difficulties in concentrating on the task when presented with the auditory system. In future studies, the auditory ERP-BCI should be adjusted by taking into consideration specific features of severely paralyzed patients, such as reduced attention span. This adjustment in combination with more intensive training will show whether an auditory ERP-BCI can become an option for visually impaired patients.},

Protractor uses a nearest neighbor approach, which recognizes an unknown gesture based on its similarity to each of the known gestures, e.g., training samples or examples given by a user. In particular, it employs a novel method to measure the similarity between gestures, by calculating a minimum angular distance between them with a closed-form solution. As a result, Protractor is more accurate, naturally covers more gesture variation, runs significantly faster and uses much less memory than its peers. This makes Protractor suitable for mobile computing, which is limited in processing power and memory. An evaluation on both a previously published gesture data set and a newly collected gesture data set indicates that Protractor outperforms its peers in many aspects.},

  abstract = {Objective. Most current electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain\textendash computer interfaces (BCIs) are based on machine learning algorithms. There is a large diversity of classifier types that are used in this field, as described in our 2007 review paper. Now, approximately ten years after this review publication, many new algorithms have been developed and tested to classify EEG signals in BCIs. The time is therefore ripe for an updated review of EEG classification algorithms for BCIs. Approach. We surveyed the BCI and machine learning literature from 2007 to 2017 to identify the new classification approaches that have been investigated to design BCIs. We synthesize these studies in order to present such algorithms, to report how they were used for BCIs, what were the outcomes, and to identify their pros and cons. Main results. We found that the recently designed classification algorithms for EEG-based BCIs can be divided into four main categories: adaptive classifiers, matrix and tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning, plus a few other miscellaneous classifiers. Among these, adaptive classifiers were demonstrated to be generally superior to static ones, even with unsupervised adaptation. Transfer learning can also prove useful although the benefits of transfer learning remain unpredictable. Riemannian geometry-based methods have reached state-of-the-art performances on multiple BCI problems and deserve to be explored more thoroughly, along with tensor-based methods. Shrinkage linear discriminant analysis and random forests also appear particularly useful for small training samples settings. On the other hand, deep learning methods have not yet shown convincing improvement over state-of-the-art BCI methods. Significance. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the modern classification algorithms used in EEG-based BCIs, presents the principles of these methods and guidelines on when and how to use them. It also identifies a number of challenges to further advance EEG classification in BCI.},

We estimated that per gesture, the thumb and the index finger may deliver at most 10 and 7 bits of information, respectively. Based on this, we derived an upper bound for the information capacity of the hand in gesture-based communication: 150 b/s. Knowing this bound is critical to evaluating the potential and limitation of the hand channel for various forms of human-machine interactions.},

METHODS Two groups of participants were tested. The first group included three amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients that varied in degree of disability, but all retained the ability to communicate; the second group included three non-ALS controls. Each participant participated in ten experimental sessions during a period of approximately 6 weeks. During each run the participant's task was to attend to one stimulus and disregard the other three. Stimuli were presented auditorily, visually, or in both modes. RESULTS Two of the 3 ALS patient's classification rates were equal to those achieved by the non-ALS participants. Waveform morphology varied as a function of the presentation mode, but not in a similar pattern for each participant. CONCLUSIONS The event-related potentials elicited by the target stimuli could be discriminated from the non-target stimuli for the non-ALS and the ALS groups. Future studies will begin to examine online classification. SIGNIFICANCE The results of offline classification suggest that a P300-based BCI can serve as a non-muscular communication device in both ALS, and non-ALS control groups.},

  abstract = {We introduce a sensing system which leverages footstep-induced structural vibration for occupant localization. Such localization is important for many smart building applications, such as efficient building management, senior/health care, and security. Compared to other sensing approaches, footstep-induced vibration provides a sensing system which is sparse and non-intrusive. The main challenge of achieving high accuracy using such approach is frequency-dependent wave propagation characteristics, such as dispersion, in floor structure. These characteristics result in distortions in the shape of signal. To overcome such distortions, we decompose the vibration signals into different frequency components using wavelet transform and focus on specific components in all the sensors. In a set of experiments in a real structure, our approach results in average localization errors of 0.41 meters, a 4.4X reduction compared to a baseline approach using raw data.},

Indoor localization is important for various smart building applications, including resources arrangement optimization, patient/customer tracking, etc. Geophones are used to measure the ground vibrations and time difference of arrival (TDoA) for different sensors are used to solve the multilateration localization problem. The advantages of this system include its sparsity and also its stability over time. Lesser dependency on instrument people is another upside of this system. The results of pilot tests show that this system can be successfully used for indoor localization.},

  abstract = {This article presents an empirical comparison of four models from manual control theory on their ability to model targeting behaviour by human users using a mouse: McRuer's Crossover, Costello's Surge, second-order lag (2OL), and the Bang-bang model. Such dynamic models are generative, estimating not only movement time, but also pointer position, velocity, and acceleration on a moment-to-moment basis. We describe an experimental framework for acquiring pointing actions and automatically fitting the parameters of mathematical models to the empirical data. We present the use of time-series, phase space, and Hooke plot visualisations of the experimental data, to gain insight into human pointing dynamics. We find that the identified control models can generate a range of dynamic behaviours that captures aspects of human pointing behaviour to varying degrees. Conditions with a low index of difficulty (ID) showed poorer fit because their unconstrained nature leads naturally to more behavioural variability. We report on characteristics of human surge behaviour (the initial, ballistic sub-movement) in pointing, as well as differences in a number of controller performance measures, including overshoot, settling time, peak time, and rise time. We describe trade-offs among the models. We conclude that control theory offers a promising complement to Fitts' law based approaches in HCI, with models providing representations and predictions of human pointing dynamics, which can improve our understanding of pointing and inform design.},

However, in the problematic area of error resolution, possible advantages of multimodal interface design remain poorly understood. In the present research, a semi automatic simulation method with a novel error generation capability was used to collect within subject data before and after recognition errors, and at different spiral depths in terms of number of repetitions required to resolve an error. Results indicated that users adopt a strategy of switching input modalities and lexical expressions when resolving errors, strategies that they use in a linguistically contrastive manner to distinguish a repetition from original failed input. Implications of these findings are discussed for the development of user centered predictive models of linguistic adaptation during human computer error resolution, and for the development of improved error handling in advanced recognition based interfaces.},

Although such an approach has been remarkably productive, it ignores the alternative possibility that brain functions are mainly intrinsic, involving information processing for interpreting, responding to and predicting environmental demands. Here I argue that the latter view best captures the essence of brain function, a position that accords well with the allocation of the brain's energy resources. Recognizing the importance of intrinsic activity will require integrating knowledge from cognitive and systems neuroscience with cellular and molecular neuroscience where ion channels, receptors, components of signal transduction and metabolic pathways are all in a constant state of flux.},

Other inputs such as the continuous pressure data provided by styluses on tablets are rarely used. We explore the design space of using the continuous pressure sensing capabilities of styluses to operate multi-state widgets. We present the results of a controlled experiment that investigates human ability to perform discrete target selection tasks by varying a stylus' pressure, with full or partial visual feedback. The experiment also considers different techniques for confirming selection once the target is acquired. Based on the experimental results, we discuss implications for the design of pressure sensitive widgets. A taxonomy of pressure widgets is presented, along with a set of initial concept sketches of various pressure widget designs.},

Probabilistic inference about the pose of the finger is carried out in real-time using a particle filter; this results in an efficient and robust pose estimator which also gives appropriate uncertainty estimates. We show empirically that tracking the full pose of the finger results in greater accuracy in pointing tasks with small targets than competitive techniques. Our model can detect and cope with different finger sizes and the use of either fingers or thumbs, bringing a significant potential for improvement in one-handed interaction with touch devices. In addition to the gain in accuracy we also give examples of how this technique could open up the space of novel interactions.},

Recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling allow inference on increasingly complex models. This class of MCMC, known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, requires gradient information which is often not readily available. PyMC3 is a new open source probabilistic programming framework written in Python that uses Theano to compute gradients via automatic differentiation as well as compile probabilistic programs on-the-fly to C for increased speed. Contrary to other probabilistic programming languages, PyMC3 allows model specification directly in Python code. The lack of a domain specific language allows for great flexibility and direct interaction with the model. This paper is a tutorial-style introduction to this software package.},

  abstract = {To determine and compare the performance of different classifiers applied to four-class EEG data is the goal of this communication. The EEG data were recorded with 60 electrodes from five subjects performing four different motor-imagery tasks. The EEG signal was modeled by an adaptive autoregressive (AAR) process whose parameters were extracted by Kalman filtering. By these AAR parameters four classifiers were obtained, namely minimum distance analysis (MDA)\textemdash for single-channel analysis, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) classifiers as well as support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for multi-channel analysis. The performance of all four classifiers was quantified and evaluated by Cohen's kappa coefficient, an advantageous measure we introduced here to BCI research for the first time. The single-channel results gave rise to topographic maps that revealed the channels with the highest level of separability between classes for each subject. Our results of the multi-channel analysis indicate SVM as the most successful classifier, whereas kNN performed worst.},

  abstract = {Alternatives to conventional wet electrode types are keenly sought for biomedical use and physiological research, especially when prolonged recording of biosignals is demanded. This paper describes a quantitative comparison of three types of bioelectrode (wet, dry and insulating) based on tests involving electrode impedance, static interference and motion artefact induced by various means. Data were collected simultaneously, and in the same physical environment for all electrode types. Results indicate that in many situations the performance of dry and insulating electrodes compares favourably with wet electrodes. The influence of non-stationary electric fields on shielded dry and insulating electrode types was compared to wet types. It was observed that interference experienced by dry and insulating electrode types was 40 dB and 34 dB less than that experienced by wet electrode types. Similarly, the effect of motion artefact on dry and insulating electrodes was compared to wet types. Artefact levels for dry and insulating electrodes were significantly higher than those for wet types at the beginning of trials conducted. By the end of the trial periods artefact levels for dry and insulating types were lower than wet electrodes by an average of 8.2 dB and 6.8 dB respectively. The reservations expressed in other studies regarding the viability of dry and insulating electrodes for reliable sensing of biosignals are not supported by the work described here.},

METHODS Two groups of participants were tested. The first group included three amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients that varied in degree of disability, but all retained the ability to communicate; the second group included three non-ALS controls. Each participant participated in ten experimental sessions during a period of approximately 6 weeks. During each run the participant's task was to attend to one stimulus and disregard the other three. Stimuli were presented auditorily, visually, or in both modes. RESULTS Two of the 3 ALS patient's classification rates were equal to those achieved by the non-ALS participants. Waveform morphology varied as a function of the presentation mode, but not in a similar pattern for each participant. CONCLUSIONS The event-related potentials elicited by the target stimuli could be discriminated from the non-target stimuli for the non-ALS and the ALS groups. Future studies will begin to examine online classification. SIGNIFICANCE The results of offline classification suggest that a P300-based BCI can serve as a non-muscular communication device in both ALS, and non-ALS control groups.},

In the near future, BCI systems that allow the user to intend a specific mental pattern whenever she/he wishes to produce such patterns will also become important. An asynchronous BCI is characterized by continuous analyzing and classification of EEG data. Therefore, it is important to maximize the hits (true positive rate) during an intended mental task and to minimize the false positive detections in the resting or idling state. EEG data recorded during right/left motor imagery is used to simulate an asynchronous BCI. To optimize the classification results, a refractory period and a dwell time are introduced.},

  abstract = {Motion correlation interfaces are those that present targets moving in different patterns, which the user can select by matching their motion. In this paper, we re-formulate the task of target selection as a probabilistic inference problem. We demonstrate that previous interaction techniques can be modelled using a Bayesian approach and that how modelling the selection task as transmission of information can help us make explicit the assumptions behind similarity measures. We propose ways of incorporating uncertainty into the decision-making process and demonstrate how the concept of entropy can illuminate the measurement of the quality of a design. We apply these techniques in a case study and suggest guidelines for future work.},

Cursor movements occurred under conditions of variations in the angle of approach to the target, the target size and shape, the distance to the target, and the nature of the task, drag-drop or point-click. In a fully crossed within-subjects design, all variables studied significantly affected movement time. Fitts' law accounted for 44\% or 97\% of the variance in movement time, depending on the method of analysis. Fitts' law was not equally effective under all combinations of the variables studied. An analysis of residuals showed that residuals were smaller for a point-click task in comparison to a drag-drop task, and residuals were lowest for the largest target displayed at the shortest distance from the starting position. The application of Fitts' law to cursor movements with a mouse should be qualified by noting the conditions under which the movements were observed.},

But although prior work has examined accuracy as the "spread of hits," no work has formulated a predictive model for error rates (0-100\%) based on Fitts' law parameters. We show that Fitts' law mathematically implies a predictive error rate model, which we derive. We then describe an experiment in which target size, target distance, and movement time are manipulated. Our results show a strong model fit: a regression analysis of observed vs. predicted error rates yields a correlation of R2=.959 for N=90 points. Furthermore, we show that the effect on error rate of target size (W) is greater than that of target distance (A), indicating a departure from Fitts' law, which maintains that W and A contribute proportionally to index of difficulty (ID). Our error model can be used with Fitts' law to estimate and predict error rates along with speeds, providing a framework for unifying this dichotomy.},

However, their model was based on one-dimensional (1-D) horizontal movement, while applications of such a model require two dimensions (2-D). In this paper, the pointing error model is investigated for 2-D pointing in a study of 21 participants performing a time-matching task on the ISO 9241-9 ring-of-circles layout. Results show that the pointing error model holds well in 2-D. If univariate endpoint deviation (SDx) is used, regressing on N=72 observed vs. predicted error rate points yields R2=.953. If bivariate endpoint deviation (SDx,y) is used, regression yields R2=.936. For both univariate and bivariate models, the magnitudes of observed and predicted error rates are comparable.},

(1) For any information-theoretic identity, is there a corresponding set-theoretic identity via the formal substitution of symbols? (2) For any set-theoretic identity, is there a corresponding information-theoretic identity and, if so, in what sense? The author establishes the analogy between information theory and set theory. Therefore, each information-theoretic operation can formally be viewed as a set-theoretic operation and vice versa. This point of view, which the author believes is of fundamental importance has apparently been overlooked in the past by information theorists. As a consequence the I-diagram, which is a geometrical representation of the relationship among the information measures, is introduced. The I-diagram is analogous to the Venn diagram in set theory. The use of the I-diagram is discussed.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Unary error correction (UEC) codes have recently been proposed for the joint source and channel coding of symbol values that are selected from a set having an infinite cardinality. However, the original UEC scheme requires the knowledge of the source probability distribution, in order to achieve near-capacity operation. This limits the applicability of the UEC scheme, since the source probability distribution is typically non-stationary and is unknown in practice. In this paper, we propose a dynamic version of the UEC scheme, which can learn the unknown source statistics and gradually improve its decoding performance during a transient phase, then dynamically adapt to the non-stationary statistics and maintain reliable near-capacity operation during a steady-state phase, at the cost of only a moderate memory requirement at the decoder. Based on the same learning technique, we also propose two separate source and channel coding benchmarkers, namely, a learning-aided Elias gamma-convolutional code (CC) scheme and a learning-aided arithmetic-CC scheme. The simulation results reveal that our proposed learning-aided UEC scheme outperforms the benchmarkers by up to 0.85 dB, without requiring any additional decoding complexity or any additional transmission-energy, -bandwidth, or -duration.},

  abstract = {Occupant activity level information is essential in many smart home applications, such as energy management and elderly care. Various methods have been proposed for detecting occupant activities through vision-, acoustic-, or radio frequency-based methods. However, the visual-based methods function only when occupants are in the visual field, the acoustic-based methods are sensitive to noise, and the radio-based methods usually require occupants to carry receivers all the time. These requirements increase the difficulty of deployment and maintenance in typical indoor smart home scenarios. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a structural vibration-based approach. Specifically, we develop a system with sparse sensor configuration deployed in the floor to monitor the activity levels of different areas. Compared to vision- and acoustic-based methods, our method is not restricted by line-of-sight and less influenced by noise. Compared to the access control system (ground truth), our system enables finer grained activity level estimation with a comparable resolution. We evaluate our system in a real-world deployment in an office building and used the building access control as the ground truth system. Our system shows a correlation coefficient at 0.836 when compared to the ground truth systems.},

  abstract = {Occupant activity level plays an important part in many smart building applications, such as power management [5] and elderly care [1]. There are several approaches to obtain occupant states, including visual-, acoustic-, and radio frequency based techniques. However, visual-based approaches require light-of-sight, while acoustic-based approaches are sensitive to background noise. On the other hand, radio-based approaches often require the occupant to carry a particular device to receive signals from base stations, which requires direct participation from the monitored occupants at all times.},
