These notes are released under an MIT license.

All notes are available as a Jupyter notebook. You can also view these notes [live on MyBinder]() if you do not wish to run locally.

## Installing

I recommend having [Anaconda]() pre-installed. To create a clean environment for these notes (my recommended approach):

* `conda create -n cix_2022_jhw`
* `conda activate cix_2022_jhw`
* `conda install ipykernel`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `jupyter notebook`
