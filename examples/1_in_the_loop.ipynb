    "* Estimate a hidden state in a continuous process from a stream of observations.\n",

    "* Be able to quantify uncertainty and the expected value of possible states.\n",

    "### Predictor-corrector\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept is simple: we first build a model that just predicts what we think might be going on -- a pure simulator. Then we can take observations and use them to \"filter out\" predictions that are unrealistic. This is formulated as a Bayesian belief update.\n",
