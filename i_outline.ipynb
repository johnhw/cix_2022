    "## Computational interaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational interaction** applies computational thinking (abstraction, automation, analysis) to explain and enhance interaction between a user and a system. It is underpinned by modelling which admits formal reasoning, and which is amenable to computational approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational interaction would typically involve at least one of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I. an explicit **mathematical model** of user-system behaviour;\n",
    "* II. a way of **updating** that model with observed data from users;\n",
    "* III. an algorithmic element that, using this model, can **directly synthesise or adapt** the\n",
    "design;\n",
    "* IV. a way of **automating and instrumenting** the modelling and design process;\n",
    "* V. the ability to **simulate or synthesise** elements of the expected user-system behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational interaction often involves elements from machine learning, signal processing, information theory,\n",
    "optimisation, inference, control theory and formal modelling.\n",

    "### What are Bayesian methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mathematically and philosophically rigorous way to manipulate **uncertainty**, based on probability theory.\n",
    "* Implementable as computational models, with a rich collection of algorithms ready and waiting.\n",
    "* Complements other computational approaches (e.g. representation learning via deep learning, optimisation approaches).\n",
    "\n",
    "> The purpose of today is to learn to *think like a Bayesian*, as well as to have a little experience *doing*. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How do they address challenges in HCI?\n",
    "Bayesian methods allow us to deal with the noisy, imprecise and weakly known human world. Computers of old were so rigid that humans had to adapt very precisely to them. How would we throw off this yoke? How could *computational power* help us do that? By reasoning about uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see how Bayesian methods can: \n",
    "\n",
    "* improve interaction in-the-loop; help you type faster and more accurately, for example;\n",
    "* improve design processes by optimising configurations even when we know very little about what works well and what doesn't;\n",
    "* improve empirical analyses of user interfaces by robustly answering questions about evaluations that we actually want to know;\n",
    "* improve how we model how humans think about interacting, even when we have limited psychological insight.\n",
