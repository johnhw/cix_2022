    "This is a problem of **inversion**; working out what was happening in the unobserved realm by deducing plausible behaviours compatible with the observations. Working out what age someone is given how tall they are is an inverse problem. Working out how tall they are given their age is a forward problem. In Bayesian modelling we use the **forward** model (the data generating process) as the key step to build our inversion model. \n",

    "[TODOINVERSIONIMAGE]\n",

    "> Other approaches solve inversion directly; for example we might build a machine learning model that predicts ages given heights by fitting a deep network to lots of paired `(age, height)` examples. We could then, at inference time, feed it a height and it would return an age. Critically, it would only return *one* age -- the best predicted age (as directed by the objective function used to train the network). This is very much **not** what we will do in the Bayesian models we will see later!"

    "* A PDF maps outcomes to *densities*. These are not probabilities. They can be >1 (but must be positive).\n",

    "* It's often necessary to work with parametric functions for PDFs -- we end up manipulating the parameters computationally.\n",

    "## Inference approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### The process of eliciting, encoding and validating\n",
    "What does it look like to *do* Bayesian modelling? We need to do several things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Elicit models (data generating processes) that we believe are good fits to the phenomena;\n",
    "* Encode our beliefs about plausible configurations of those models mathematically, as prior distributions on parameters.\n",
    "* Infer posterior distributions over those parameters using an inference algorithm.\n",
    "* Validate that our modelling assumptions held true.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Elicit and encode\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Validate\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concrete algorithms for inference\n",
    "In general, we wouldn't use the grid type models we have seen for real problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Q: Why not?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical algorithms for problems that involve continuous variables fall into three basic types. We'll see each type applied to a very simple problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exact\n",
    "Very occasionally, we can compute the exact density function for a posterior distribution by some algebraic trickery. This is only possible if our prior and likelihood have a very specific form. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data structure\n",
    "* Parameter vectors (associated with density functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We have a **parametric** form for our prior density $f(\\theta)$ (e.g. a normal distribution with parameters $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$).\n",
    "* We have a collection of observations\n",
    "* We have a **parametric** likelihood that is compatible with our prior density function; $L(x|\\phi)$\n",
    "* We run an algorithm that computes a **parametric** density function for the posterior $g(\\psi)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f$, $L$ and $g$ don't have to have the same form (e.g. they might not all be normal), but they do have to be compatible (\"conjugate priors\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros and cons\n",
    "\n",
    "* Advantages: Extremely efficient; no approximation error.\n",
    "* Disadvantages: constrains you to a small range of modelling choices; requires special implementation for each case; can be complicated to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MCMC\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data structure\n",
    "* Samples (i.e. sequences of values in the sample space *of parameters*)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros and cons\n",
    "* Advantages: extremely general (\"one button inference\"); samples are easy to work with (just arrays of definite numbers); lots of sophisticated algorithms\n",
    "* Disadvantages: may not converge; lots of tuning and tweaking to get sampling to work; some problems are very resistant to sampling based solutions (e.g. exotic geometry, partially discrete problems)\n",

    "* Applies algorithms such as MCMC or variational inference to infer probability distributions over hidden states from observed data.\n",
    "* Implements data generating processes as computational simulators of expected phenomena, and can simulate concrete implications of hypotheses.\n",
    "* Reports and summarises inferences via approximations that are computationally tractable (e.g. via random samples)\n",
    "* Is typically concerned with *expectations* of a score function applied to a distribution, such as utility.\n",

    "### Why is this Computational HCI?\n",
    "\n",
    "* We build **statistical models** of user behaviour, and estimate parameters of that model from quantitative observations of data. \n",
    "* This is a **model-led approach** which has a strong mathematical underpinning and many powerful algorithms which can be brought to bear.\n",
    "* This is **robust** (it appropriately represents uncertainty) and **generative** (it can simulate behaviour compatible with observations).  "
