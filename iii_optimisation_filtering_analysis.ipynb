    "## Goal\n",
    "* Estimate a hidden state in a continuous process from a stream of observations.\n",
    "* Be able to deal with missing or noisy observations.\n",
    "* Be able to project forward into the future as needed.\n",
    "* Be able to quantify uncertainty and the expected value of possible states.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process\n",
    "* We build a **filter**, which in this context means a process that combines observations that occur sequentially.\n",
    "    * Note: it's not really the same as a filter in the sense of signal processing, though the concept of processing sequential signals is the same.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* The data generating process is assumed to have some temporal coherence; predictions of the future depend on past states.\n",
    "    * Typically, we make a Markov assumption: that the current unobserved state encodes everything we know about the next state.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Predictor-corrector\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept is simple: we first build a model that just predicts what we think might be going on -- a pure simulator. Then we can take observations and use them to \"filter out\" predictions that are unrealistic. This is formulated as a Bayesian belief update.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prior at time t + evidence at time t -> posterior at time t\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X_{t+1}|Y_t, X_t) \\propto P(Y_t | X_{t+1}) P(X_{t+1})$$\n",

    "\n",
    "* (we don't typically care about normalising this distribution, we just want to track *relative* likelihoods of hypotheses)"
